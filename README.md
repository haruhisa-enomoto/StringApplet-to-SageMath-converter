# StringApplet to SageMath converter

This modules [`converter.py`](https://github.com/haruhisa-enomoto/StringApplet-to-SageMath-converter/blob/main/converter.py) is for [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/), and aimed at people studying representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras. This enables us to deal with the lattice of torsion classes in SageMath very easily.

[String Applet](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~jgeuenich/string-applet/) is a very useful tool for studying algebras and module categories,
which is a web program developed by [Jan Geuenich](https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~jgeuenich/).
We can input various algebras into String Applet intuitively, and this applet provides lots of information of a given algebra.

This module [`converter.py`](https://github.com/haruhisa-enomoto/StringApplet-to-SageMath-converter/blob/main/converter.py) enables us to
construct a poset (lattice) of torsion classes of a given algebra in [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)
from the file exported from String Applet.
